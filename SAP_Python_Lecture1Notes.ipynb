    "    * NUMBERS (10, 23.89, 0x100, 3.1j)\n",

    "    * INTEGER - signed integer - [0, 1, 2, 3 .... etc]\n",
    "    * LONG - long integer, octal and hexadecimal - [51924361L, 0x19323L .... etc]\n",
    "    * FLOAT - floating point real values - [0.32, 100.2, 54.67899 .... etc]\n",
    "    * COMPLEX - standard complex numbers - [7.12j, 0.876j, 23j ... etc]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's run some examples. As mentioned before, the vast range of Python libraries is what makes Python GREAT. In today's lecture, we are introducing a library called NumPy, which is a compilation of mathematical functions and arrays (or vectors) operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, sqrt, pow, ... etc). To import libraries you need to tell Python to fetch a given library and give it a tag name.\n",

    "#### Problem 1\n",
    "Write a code capable of determining the force of repulsion ($F_{r}$) between two atoms. Estimate $F_{r}$ for the following cases:\n",
    "    * Two Argon Atoms, Separated By: 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 [nm]\n",
    "    * Two Xenon Atoms, Separated By: 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 [nm]\n",
    "    * One Argon and One Xenone Atom, Separated By: 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 [nm]\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should accept keyboard-input to receive the three cases. Using a loop and a conditinal, print on the screen the results for when d bigger than 0.5 [nm], for all three cases. Also, still using loops and conditionals, print out which combination yield the strongest repulsion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the Argon atomic number is 18, and the Xenon atomic number is 54. Also, remember that the repulsion force between atoms can be described by Coulumb's law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$F_{r} = \\frac{1}{4\\cdot \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\cdot \\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{d^{2}}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where $F_{r}$ is the repulsion force, $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space ($8.85x10^{-12} [N\\cdot m^{2}/C^{2}]$), $q_{1}$ is first charge, $q_{2}$ is the second charge and $d$ is the distance between them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Your code should include at least 2 function and 2 loops (all results must be printed on the screen with clear labling).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 2\n",
    "For this exercise we are going to work with the Photoelectric effect. As a reminder, the Photoelectric effect is the emission of charge (electrons) when a material is hit by light of a certain wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(\\lambda) = \\left( \\frac{\\hbar \\cdot c}{\\lambda} \\right) - \\psi$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $E(\\lambda)$ is the energy of the released electron, $\\hbar$ is the Plack constant ($4.136×10^{−15}$ [eVs]), $c$ is the speed of light, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incoming photon, and $\\psi$ is the work function of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to design an experiment that relies on the production of electrons via the Photoelectric effect, with different materials. Say you have 2 lasers in your lab (properties below) and you want to select the laser that work best with all material. \n",
    "    * Write a code that asks you to select a material (via keyboard input) between the following: Si, Al, Au, and Ti.\n",
    "    * Write a function that given your selection returns the appropiate work function (see table below for numbers). \n",
    "    * Write another function that reproduces the output spectrum from the lasers (Assume it's Gaussian).  \n",
    "    * In the main body, use loops and conditional statements to compare lasers.\n",
    "    * Print your results on the screen with clear labels.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Work functions table:\n",
    "    * Si - 4.60 [eV]\n",
    "    * Al - 4.26 [eV]\n",
    "    * Au - 5.10 [eV]\n",
    "    * Ti - 4.33 [eV]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasers Properties:\n",
    "    * Laser 1: $\\mu$ = 950 [nm], $\\sigma$ = 285 [nm]\n",
    "    * Laser 2: $\\mu$ = 750 [nm], $\\sigma$ = 300 [nm]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 3\n",
    "write a code that generates 500 random numbers following the Gaussian distribution from Problem 2 (Laser 1). In your code (via loops and conditionals) estimate how many numbers have been generated within 1$\\sigma$, 2$\\sigma$ and 3$\\sigma$. Compare your results with the thoretical expectation. "
